# Single-cell-RNA-seq-Processing

## Description

To further define the transcriptional landscape of grafted dopamine neurons, we performed single cell mRNA sequencing from p53 wild-type (WT) and p53 knock-out (KO) grafted neurons, re-isolated from the mouse brain at 1 dpt. This is the processing pipeline to generate the figures used in the accompanying paper.

### Executing program

Run combinedday1replicates.R to obtain the proccessed single cell experiment. Please run additional processing on the object using the processing script. Also, run cell_line_d25.R to obtain a processed single cell experiment for day 25 in vitro cellline dataset. Then run Figures.R to convert to a seurat object and obtain the figures in figure 5 and Supplement figure 5
