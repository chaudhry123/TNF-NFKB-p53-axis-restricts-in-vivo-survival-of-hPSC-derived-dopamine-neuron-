# CRISPR Screen Data Processing

### Executing program

To obtain the processed CRISPR screen experiment, refer to [this repository](https://github.com/chaudhry123/TNF-NFKB-p53-axis-restricts-in-vivo-survival-of-hPSC-derived-dopamine-neuron-/tree/main/CRISPR-screen-processing) or the [GEO repository](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE217131).

Subsequently, run through the code presented in `code-to-generate-fig-1.Rmd`.

The code generates the correlation diagram, volcano plots, and the heat map.
